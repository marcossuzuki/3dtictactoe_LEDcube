# 3dtictactoe_LEDcube

Development of a three-dimensional tic-tac-toe, instead of the board is used a cube of LED's RGB. A control was developed with 7 switches and a joystick that uses two potentiometers for space movements.

Arduino was used for programming controls, LEDs lighting and game rules.

Material used:
01 Arduino UNO;
Cables Jumpers;
27 RGB LEDs common anode;
01 10k resistor;
02 Resistor of 2,2k;
03 1k resistors;
03 MOSFET Transistor IRF9530N;
01 Joystick with potentiometer;
06 tactil switches;
02 CI TLC9540NT.
