# 3dtictactoe_LEDcube

Development of a three-dimensional tic-tac-toe, instead of the board is used a cube of LED's RGB. A control was developed with 7 switches and a joystick that uses two potentiometers for space movements.

Arduino was used for programming controls, LEDs lighting and game rules.
